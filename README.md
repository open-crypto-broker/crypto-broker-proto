# Crypto Broker Protobuf

This repository contains the definitions for the protobuf messages that will be shared across the Crypto Broker clients and the server. This repository is imported as a Git submodule on each client and server in order to use the exact same version on all apps.

## Message structure

### Messages

- **Metadata**:  
  Contains basic information about a request, such as a unique ID and creation timestamp. This helps track and identify requests.

- **HashRequest**:  
  Used to ask the server to hash some input. It includes the Crypto Profile to use, the input to be hashed and a RequestMetadata.

- **HashResponse**:  
  Contains the resulting hash value, the used hash algorithm and Metadata about the hashing process.

- **SignRequest**:  
  Used to request a digital signature for a certificate signing request (CSR). It includes the Crypto Profile, CSR data, signing key, validity period offsets, CA certificate, and Metadata. Optionally, a subject and a CRL distribution point URL can be added.

- **SignResponse**:  
  Contains the signed certificate generated by the server and the metadata.

### Functions

- **Hash**:  
  Takes a `HashRequest` and returns a `HashResponse`. This is used to generate a hash of the provided input using the hashing algorithm specified by the profile.

- **Sign**:  
  Takes a `SignRequest` and returns a `SignResponse`. This is used to sign a CSR based on the profile's settings and return the signed certificate.
